1 build a vocabulary
dtm/dtm_vocabulary.py
input: a .txt file contains all data
output: a all_term.dat file contains all terms

2 convert documents to the format required by the model
dtm/dtm_mult.py
input: a .txt file contains text & all_term.dat
output: a foo-mult.data contains the modeling data
batch mode:batch_data.sh

3 create a sequence of topic nums
graph/topic_num_stat.py
input: a .csv file contatins numbers of documents for each year
output: a list of .csv file contains topic nums and inital values of the alpha parameter
